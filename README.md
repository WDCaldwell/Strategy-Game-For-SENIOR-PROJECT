# Overview
It will be a tuned based strategy game where each match played on a square tile board that will be no smaller than 5 tiles by 5 tiles.

Initial planning will be around the idea that all the units will be set up in an initialization phase for ‘turn 0’ where the game will play from there.

Any specifics of units, ability’s, spells shall be determent at a later date. Any such as implementing a card game style twist or an additional strategic layer where multiple matches will be played in a single game will be stretch goals. The question right now is if multiplayer would fall under the stretch goals.
